# lumetree

A very simple links page for Lume. Pretty much a Lume-ified
[LinkFree](https://michaelbarney.github.io/LinkFree/), they deserve
all the love.

## How to use

1. Clone this repository or download the tarball.
2. Update `_data/site.yml` with what you want.
3. Test it on your machine with `deno task serve`.
4. When you're happy, run `deno task build` to build your site in `_site`,
   and add it to whichever hosting service you want.
